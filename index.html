    The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.[5] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted,<br> 
    more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field:<br> 
    "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P<br> 
    if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.<br>
    "[6] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally<br> 
    operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms.<br> 
    This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence",<br> 
    in which the question "Can machines think?" is replaced with the question <br>
    "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?".[7] In Turing's proposal the various characteristics<br> 
    that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed.<br>
