<h2>F1 score</h2>
 <p>In statistical analysis of binary classification,the <strong>F1 score (also <u>F-score</u> or
<u>F-measure</u>)</strong>is a measure of a test's accuracy.<br>
It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score:<br>
p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results<br>
returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided
by the number of all relevant samples<br>
(all samples that should have been identified as positive).<br>
The F1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall,<br>
where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1<br>
(perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.<br></p>
